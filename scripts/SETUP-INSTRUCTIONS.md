## Step 1: Open Google Apps Script

1. Open your FPCA Google Sheet
2. Click **Extensions** in the menu bar
3. Click **Apps Script**
4. A new tab will open with the Apps Script editor

## Step 2: Add the Script Code

1. In the Apps Script editor, you'll see a default file called `Code.gs`
2. **Delete all existing code** in the file
3. Open the file `google-apps-script.js` from this folder
4. **Copy the entire contents** of that file
5. **Paste it** into the Apps Script editor

## Step 3: Configure Your Email

1. Near the top of the script, find this line:
   ```javascript
   const NOTIFICATION_EMAIL = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```
2. Replace `your-email@example.com` with your actual email address
3. Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

## Step 4: Deploy the Web App

1. Click **Deploy** in the top right
2. Click **New deployment**
3. Click the gear icon next to "Select type"
4. Choose **Web app**
5. Fill in the deployment settings:
   - **Description**: "FPCA Membership Form Handler" (or any description)
   - **Execute as**: Select **Me** (your email)
   - **Who has access**: Select **Anyone**
6. Click **Deploy**

## Step 5: Authorize the App

1. A popup will appear asking for authorization
2. Click **Authorize access**
3. Select your Google account
4. You may see a warning that says "Google hasn't verified this app"
   - Click **Advanced**
   - Click **Go to [project name] (unsafe)**
5. Click **Allow** to grant the necessary permissions

## Step 6: Copy the Web App URL

1. After deployment, you'll see a dialog with the **Web app URL**
2. It will look like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/xxxxx.../exec`
3. **Copy this URL** - you'll need to provide it to Jose

## Step 7: Provide URL to Jose

Send the Web App URL to Jose so they can update the website code.

## Troubleshooting

### Form submits but no data in sheet

- Try redeploying the web app

### No email notifications

- Verify the NOTIFICATION_EMAIL is correct in the script
- Check Gmail sending limits (500/day for free accounts)

### "Script function not found" error
- Make sure you copied the entire script code
- Save the file and redeploy

### Permission errors
- Re-authorize the app by going to Deploy > Manage deployments
- Delete the current deployment and create a new one

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

The current setup stores subscription preferences as TRUE/FALSE values, making it easy to:

- Export subscriber lists for email campaigns
- Integrate with email marketing tools (Mailchimp, SendGrid, etc.)
- Add automated newsletter functionality
